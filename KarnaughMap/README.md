# KarnaughMap

### Task:

Develop a program in C++. The program takes as input a truth table (TT) of a Boolean function for four variables (you can determine the data structure for the TT yourself). The program must
 1) construct a Karnaugh map (KM) using TT; 
 2) using KM to construct a shortened DNF; 
 3) display the resulting formula in a readable form on the screen.

The program must be compiled and run under Linux, preferably having build scripts (Makefile) and a set of tests.
